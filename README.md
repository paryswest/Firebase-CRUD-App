# Firebase Crud App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Small CRUD application using React as a framework and a Baas (Firebase) for this list. Tested out my React skills and challenged myself to see if I could implement firebase to store data on to Google's cloud servers.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, React, Firebase

I definitely didn't worry too much about styling on this project as my main focus was to just make sure that I have the correct implementation insofar as setting up React correctly and using Firebase to be able to successfully add and delete dataâ€”so even if the browser is reloaded, the data is gone (unless re-entered from the side of the database). 

## Optimizations
- Give some more styling (wasn't my aim when I initially made this app).
- More than likely organize in to separate components.
- See if code can be optimized in some way.

## Lessons Learned:

I definitely learned alot about Use state and Use effect in this application. I also struggled ALOT with making this months ago, so I more than likely will review this project and see if I can update some code to get this written better.
