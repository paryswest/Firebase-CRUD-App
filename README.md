# Firebase Crud App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# My Awesome Project
Small CRUD application using React as a framework and a Baas (Firebase) for this list. Tested out my React skills and challenged myself to see if I could implement firebase to store data on to Google's cloud servers.   

**Link to project:** Coming soon

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, React, Firebase

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
